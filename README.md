#LMD Team Project : Fierce-Killer-Whale (status: complete)

##Team Fierce-Killer-Whale : Léna Faure and Ruben Ruiz

Léna Faure and Ruben Ruiz join forces to create Team Fierce-Killer-Whale.

Team project 1 is to build out Books.Modern Developer UI based on a mockup provided by the Modern Developer team, and Team project 2 is to write Encyclopedia entries for Encyclopedia.ModernDeveloper.com.

We've decided to use Github for collaboration and QA.modern developer for communication for these two projects.


##Workflow and workload

###Project 1 : Build the UI for Books.Modern Developer

[Link to Github Repo](https://github.com/carpefukendiem/LMD-TeamProject1)

[Link to Demo site](https://carpefukendiem.github.io/LMD-TeamProject1/)

The workload is split in the following way: 

**Ruben**: create layout of page (structure, header, nav, footer)

**Léna**: create the "book" sections

Since the layout comes first, Ruben creates the Github project and Lena will collaborate on it.


###Project 2 : Create Cheatsheet Encyclopedia Entries for Encyclopedia.ModernDeveloper.com

[Link to Github Repo](https://github.com/lenafaure/LMD-TeamProject2)


The workload is split in the following way: 

Léna will create the repo and Ruben will pull request with his work.

**Léna**: Evens

**Ruben**: Odds

We then link to that repo from our coursework repo, in the README.md for the chapter. 

#### Encyclopedia entries : 

1. `<form>`
2. `<em>`
3. `background-image`
4. `margin-bottom`
5. `Math.max()`
6. `String.prototype.replace()`
