##Workflow and workload

###Project 1 : Build the UI for Books.Modern Developer

[Link to Demo site]()

We've decided to use github and QA.modern developer to communicate for this first project. The workload is split in the folowing way: 

**Ruben**: create layout of page (structure, header, nav, footer)
**Lena**: create the "book" section

Since the layout comes first, Ruben creates the Github project and Lena will collaborate on.

###Project 2 : Create Cheatsheet Encyclopedia Entries for Encyclopedia.ModernDeveloper.com

[Link to Github Repo](https://github.com/lenafaure/LMD-TeamProject2)

Lena will create the repo and Ruben will pull request with his work.

**Lena**: Evens
**Ruben**: Odds

We then link to that repo from our coursework repo, in the README.md for the chapter. 

#### Encyclopedia entries : 

1. `<form>`
2. `<em>`
3. `background-image`
4. `margin-bottom`
5. `Math.max()`
6. `String.prototype.replace()`
